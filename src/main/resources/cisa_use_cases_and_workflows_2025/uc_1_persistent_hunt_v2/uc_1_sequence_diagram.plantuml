	' Stage 1: Adversary TTP Observation and Analytic Creation
	Reporter -> T3: Report new adversary TTP
	T3 -> Platform: Develop detection analytic
	
	' Stage 2: Detection Execution and Alerting
	Platform -> Platform: Run analytic on visibility data
	Platform -> SIEM: Generate alert
	SIEM -> SN: Auto-triage alerts, create ticket if critical
	
	' Stage 3: Tier 1 Analyst Triage
	SN -> T1: Notify of new ticket
	T1 -> SIEM: Investigate and pivot across datasets
	T1 -> SN: Annotate and reassign ticket to Tier 2 or close
	
	' Stage 4: Tier 2 Analyst Deep Analysis
	SN -> T2: Notify of reassigned ticket
	T2 -> Platform: Query full datasets (Elastic, Databricks)
	T2 -> T2: Develop notebooks and execute advanced queries
	T2 -> SN: Reassign ticket to Tier 3 or Production, or close
	T2 -> KB: Archive artifacts (via ServiceNow/AWS S3)
	
	' Stage 5: Production Development
	SN -> Prod: Notify Production Staff
	Prod -> SN: Kick off workflow for automated product template
	Prod -> Prod: Finalize and stage content (collateral, LLM-generated)
	Prod -> SN: Close ticket and workflow
	
	' Stage 6: Tier 3 Analyst Enhancements
	SN -> T3: Notify of backlog ticket
	T3 -> Platform: Use ticket data to improve models
	T3 -> Platform: Deploy updated detection analytic
	T3 -> SN: Close out ticket
	T3 -> KB: Archive updated detection content
