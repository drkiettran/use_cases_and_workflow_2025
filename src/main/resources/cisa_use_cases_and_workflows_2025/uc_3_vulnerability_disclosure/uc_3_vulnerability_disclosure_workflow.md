# Use Case #3: VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE

1. CISA customer or stakeholder notifies CISA of a new vulnerability via VINCE (or other identification or intake process).  ServiceNow ticket is automatically created if request comes in by web intake, or help desk personnel create ticket manually. 
2. Tier 1 analyst reviews ticket in ServiceNow, following up with reporting entity to collect critical information as needed. Where appropriate, Tier 1 analyst assigns ticket to Tier 2 for further analysis. Automated prevalence and exposure analytics are kicked off based on device/software version details.
3. Tier 2 analyst reviews ticket information in ServiceNow.
	- As needed, Tier 2 analyst requests the creation of an analytic workspace in AWS, for functional testing and analysis of vendor product(s) or technologies associated with the vulnerability.
	- As needed, Tier 2 analyst grants workspace access to vendors or other partners for the purpose of analytic collaboration or disclosure coordination.
	- Tier 2 analyst works to close out Disclosure workflow by handing off ticket to Production team via ServiceNow.
	- Tier 2 analyst captures and catalogs analysis artifacts, as appropriate, for archive in Analytic Knowledge Base (ServiceNow front end, AWS S3 back end).
4. As needed, Tier 2 analyst creates ticket in ServiceNow for Tier 3 data scientists and analysts to create related behavioral, detection, or other advanced analytics to manage risk associated with the vulnerability.
	+ Tier 3 analyst develops analytic in Databricks notebook. Tier 3 analyst uses the existing analytic workspace in AWS to gain understanding of potential adversary behavior associated with the vulnerability.  
	+ Tier 3 analyst productionizes analytic, sending analytic results to Elastic, where other analysts can review and triage them (creating a new workflow).
	+ Tier 3 analyst hands off ticket to Production team in ServiceNow. 
	+ Tier 3 analyst captures and catalogs analysis artifacts, as appropriate, for archive in Analytic Knowledge Base (ServiceNow front end, AWS S3 back end).
5. Production staff triages handed-off tickets in ServiceNow.
	+ Production staff completes Disclosure workflow by coordinating with vendors and end users. Reporting and collateral are created with automated templates populated using information in ServiceNow ticket. 
	+ Production staff completes public release of analytic product via CISA git repository. Collateral to support the release are created using automated templates populated from ServiceNow ticket data.
