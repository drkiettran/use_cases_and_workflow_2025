	' Step 1 - Ticket creation
	Customer --> SN : Request IR assistance (Web/Helpdesk)
	SN --> T1 : Notify Tier 1 analyst
	
	' Step 2 - Tier 1 collection and assignment
	T1 --> Customer : Follow up for critical info
	T1 --> SN : Update ticket with info
	T1 --> CCM : Assign ticket
	
	' Step 3 - Cyber Case Manager actions

	CCM --> SN : Validate access & legal agreements
	CCM --> SN : Plan data collection (if ongoing intrusion)
	CCM --> T2 : Assign IR lead / Tier 2 analyst
	
	' Step 4 - Tier 2 forensic analysis
	T2 --> SN : Review ticket info
	T2 --> Customer : Request access, deploy sensors/agents
	Customer --> SN : Upload network/endpoint/EDR data
	SN --> DB : Send data for triage
	DB --> T2 : Provide triage analytics results
	T2 --> AWS : Conduct forensic analysis
	T2 --> SN : Populate report template, update ticket
	T2 --> Prod : Hand off ticket
	T2 --> AKB : Archive analysis artifacts
	
	' Step 5 - Production staff workflow
	SN --> Prod : Notify ticket assignment
	Prod --> SN : Review, trigger workflow
	Prod --> SN : Generate product & collateral (LLM/templates)
	Prod --> SN : Close workflow + ticket
